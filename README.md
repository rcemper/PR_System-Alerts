# System-Alerts
2024 InterSystems FHIR and Digital Health Interoperability Contest!

## About the Project
This project captures critical InterSystems IRIS for Health integration production information at runtime and will generate an email detailing the data. The information contained in the email includes: counts of messages in Error, Suspended, Queues, and Alerts.  Additionally, the email reports the database file sizing, folder space, and certificate expiration dates. The generated email helps users identify potential issues within a production as well as assisting with deriving trends with issue counts.
